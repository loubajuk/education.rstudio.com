We recently surveyed people who have taken part in our
[instructor training and certification program](http://education.rstudio.com/trainers/).

FIXME: quantitative results

## Qualitative results

We also asked three open questions.
Some people gave multiple answers for each,
while others skipped some or all of them,
but some patterns did emerge.

### What did you like best and/or find most useful?

The ten most common responses (in order) were:

-   Learner personas
-   Concept maps
-   Formative assessment
-   Online teaching methods
-   Reverse instructional design
-   Cognitive load
-   Parsons Problems
-   Faded examples
-   Format of training course
-   Summative assessment

### What did you like least and/or find least useful?

Only eight items were mentioned more than once:

-   Concept maps
-   Course as a whole too short
-   Online format
-   Lack of tips for online/asynchronous teaching
-   Time of day
-   No explicit coverage of Tidyverse/Shiny exam material
-   Material on psychology of learning not new
-   Sessions too long

### What else do you think we should know about the program and how to improve it?

There was even more spread here---only five things were mentioned more than once:

-   More guidance about exam content
-   More tidyverse-specific content
-   Refresher seminars and other follow-up
-   More about online teaching
-   Spread the course out and take more time on each part
